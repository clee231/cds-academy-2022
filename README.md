# CDS Academy 2022 - Day 20

This repo contains the days I facilitated and the related Terraform code.

This can be used as reference for how to build your infrastructure with Terraform.

While writing Terraform code is not required as part of these days, writing it in this manner allows you to repeat and audit your steps easily.

The files are written without variablization for demonstration purposes. In a well-managed project, use variables as necessary.
